    gui.console:
        - Extended status bar to contain connection information.
        - Added notion of "current user".
        - Added menu option to save current connection settings / options.
        - Added menu option to easily restore all saved connection settings.
    gui.peek:
        - New GUI module. Essentially the next version of proc peek (cmd line version now obsoleted).
    gui.pstalker:
        - Added timestamp column.
        - Made columns sortable.
    pgraph:
        - Set default depth for graph_down() and graph_up() to infinite.
        - Added logic to correctly handle newlines in node/edge labels during uDraw rendering.
        - Added 'image' and 'info' (mouse over popup) support to uDraw rendering.
    pstalker:
        - Fixed handle leak in usage of iterate_modules().
    pydbg:
        - Improved detection of system breakpoints by resolving ntdll!DbgBreakPoint.
        - Added logic for compatability with DebugBreakProcess() API.
        - Bug fix in context dump (EBP was being resolved as ESI).
        - Added MSR read/write support: read_msr(), write_msr().
        - Added optional 'hex_dump' flag to smart_dereference to return hex dump in place of undetected strings.
        - .disasm() routine now returns "[UNKNOWN]" when unable to process instruction.
        - Added get_register() routine to compliment set_register().
        - Fixed handle leak in addr_to_module().
        - Added warning about handle leaks when break-ing out of iterate_xxx() routines.
        - Bug fix during context dump of an exhausted stack.
    pydasm:
        - Bundled new version of pydasm which manually fixes a memory leak that was affecting PaiMei.


09.13.2006 [REV 122]
    docs:
        - Fixed bug in PyDbg snippet example.
        - Added basic documentation for public-release FileFuzz GUI module.
    pida:
        - Fixed bugs in rendering of GML graphs.
    gui.filefuzz:
        - Added multi-byte modifications feature.
        - Fixed bug in statistic tracking.
    heap_trace:
        - Added tool for heap alloc/free tracking, useful for finding heap spray / memory leak vectors.
    pida:
        - wx is not longer a mandatory requirement for using the PIDA module.
    gui.pstalker:
        - Implemented CLI option to "watch for" and attach to a target process.
    pydbg:
        - Fixed handle leaks in load() routine.
        - Fixed handle leaks in pydbg_core.
        - Implemented hide_debugger() routine to hide from IsDebuggerPresent().
        - Replaced various instances of DBG_CONTINUE with the more approriate DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, this fix allows
          for improved handling of debugging files with anti-debugging functionality.
        - Fixed bug where breakpoints deleted from their own handler were still being restored.
        - Added page_guard_clear() and page_guard_restore() functionality. This is useful for suspending memory
          breakpoints to single step past a REP instruction.
        - Added optional string 'prefix' argument to hex_dump() for customizing generated dumps.
        - Removed assumption from func_resolve_debuggee() that all DLLs end in ".dll" (ie: QuickTime: .qts/.qtx)
        - Replaced usage of '\\' with os.sep in system_dll.py.
        - Bug fixes in cleanup() routines.
    utils:
        - MySQLdb is not longer a mandatory requirement for using the utils module.


07.27.2006 [REV 97]
    dpc:
        - Disabled debug logging by defalt.
    pydbg:
        - Added get_instruction() libdasm wrapper.
        - Replaced logic of to_decimal() routine with a *much* simpler one-liner.
        - Added logic to improve differentiation between single step events and hardware breakpoint hits.
    pydbg_core:
        - Fixed multiple handle / memory leaks.
        - Decoupled debug event handling from debug_event_loop(), in anticipation of utilizing the handler code
          separately to implement step() / step_over() functionality.
        - load() routine now obtains debug privileges just as attach() does.
    utils:
        - Added new utility, hooking, a helper class for abstracted API hooking. (see: http://openrce.org/blog/view/368)
    pgraph:
        - Robustness improvement in rendering of edges where the src or dst node does not exist.
        - Added logic to make a best effort guess at node width/height in the absence of explicit values.
    pstalker:
        - Modified mark labels in IDC generation for cleaner sorting.

    __install_requirements.py:
        - Fixed incorrect path bug.
    dpc:
        - Changed allocation page permissions for NX compatability.
        - Added logic to free previously allocated instruction container.
        - Fixed bug in context restore prior to exit that was causing some applications to crash on detach.
    pydbg_core:
        - Fixed bug in enumerate_modules(), the routine was actually unfinished and included a debug print message.
        - Robustness bug fix in load() routine.
    pydbg:
        - Fixed bug in hardware breakpoint handling, sloppy error in last minute addition of custom handlers.
    pstalker:
        - Added confirmation dialog to 'confirm' right-click handler.
        - Exposed advanced (CLI toggled) option for disabling breakpoint hit logging (speed increase).
    ollydbg_receiver:
        - Added command line options for specifying host and port of uDraw server.
    docs:
        - Updated the documentation.
        - Most important change being the renaming of "PIDA file" to "PIDA module" ;-)
